# Operational Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyses operational task completion data to assess efficiency, identify delay patterns, and highlight workflow bottlenecks using Microsoft Excel.

The analysis focuses on task timeliness, delay severity, and performance differences across task types to support operational decision-making.

---

## Business Question
- How efficiently are operational tasks being completed?
- What proportion of tasks are delayed?
- Are delays concentrated within specific task types?

---

## Dataset
The dataset represents one operational quarter of completed tasks. Each record includes task type, department, expected completion time, actual completion time, and priority.

A derived metric, **DelayDays**, was used to quantify the difference between expected and actual task completion time.

---

## Methodology
- Validated date and duration logic
- Structured data using Excel tables
- Defined KPIs aligned with operational efficiency
- Used PivotTables to analyse task delays by status and task type
- Created summary visualisations and an executive-level report

---

## Key Findings
- 55% of tasks were completed later than expected, indicating systemic delays
- Customer Support tasks exhibited the highest average delay (1.6 days)
- Delays were unevenly distributed across task categories

---

## Recommendations
- Conduct a targeted review of Customer Support workflows and resourcing
- Monitor delay metrics by task type on an ongoing basis
- Use delay trends to evaluate the impact of corrective actions

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Tables, PivotTables, calculated fields, charts)

---

## This project uses simulated but realistic operational data for portfolio demonstration purposes.
